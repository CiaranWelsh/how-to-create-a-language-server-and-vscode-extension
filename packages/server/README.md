ðŸ’¡ This package was created as a part of the [_"How to create a language server and VS Code extension"_ article](https://github.com/donaldpipowitch/how-to-create-a-language-server-and-vscode-extension). Don't expect a fully featured and supported package, but feel free to use it, if you find it useful. ðŸ’¡

## Setup

```bash
$ npm install @donaldpipowitch/vscode-extension-server
```
